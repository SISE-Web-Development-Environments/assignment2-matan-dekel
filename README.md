couple of notes:

a. we added two special functionalities:

1. black food that in a coin flip adds or reduce 40 points from your score. the black food is *not* calculated as one of the "number of balls" selected in the settings. 

2. we added a clock. when the pacman eats it, he gain 15 more seconds to his game.

b.when pacman eats all the balls, the game is over.
